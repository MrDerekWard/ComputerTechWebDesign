            <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
            <p>As part of your Computer Tech class, you will design a website that looks similar to this example. You'll be using Chat GPT again to learn how to design a website from scratch, just as I did. If your teacher, who has no prior experience in teaching Computer Science until this year, can figure it out in less than 20 minutes, you can certainly figure it out too! </p>
            <p>In addition to learning how to design a website, you'll also learn how to modify the HTML code to add the content you want, and the CSS code to style it according to your preferences. You'll have all of this week to work on your website in class and deisgn it exactly the way you want.</p>
			<p>You have the option to select from two topics for designing your website:</p>
    		<h3>Option 1: Personal Portfolio</h3>
    		<p>Create a personal portfolio to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements. You can include sections such as an About Me, Extracurricular Activities, Skills, Academic Achievements, and more. This portfolio does not have to be about your Computer Tech class; you can showcase any skills or accomplishments you want.</p>
    		<h3>Option 2: Career Path Website</h3>
    		<p>Create a website about the career path you aspire to pursue after completing high school and the steps you must take to make that career a reality. You can include information about the desired career, educational requirements, skills needed, and any other relevant details.</p>

          <section id="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>To get started, there are 2 different sets of instructions that you can follow:</p>
            <h3>First Set</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Figure out how to do the entire thing on your own by asking Chat GPT to guide you. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Second Set</h3>
            <ol>
				<li>Open the pre-installed text editor, Notepad, on your computer.</li>
				<li>Create a new file and save it with the extension .html.</li>
				<li>Type the basic structure of an HTML document, including the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags. Or use Chat GPT to create the code you need.</li> 
		     		<li>Start by giving Chat GPT prompts about using HTML to design a website portfolio or a website about the career you've chosen.</li>
				<li>To change and add style to your website, you need to add CSS code. You can also use Chat GPT for the CSS code to help style your website or to style specific areas of your website if you already have an idea about the way you want it to look. You can even write it on your own as you get familiar with how the code works.</li>
                		<li>To input the CSS code Chat GPT gives you, you'll need to create a new file and save it with the extension .css.</li>
                		<li>Ask Chat GPT how to apply your CSS code to your HTML code so that the style changes appear.</li>
				<li>Save your HTML and CSS files, then go find where you saved the HTML file and open it with Google Chrome to see your website in action!</li>
                		<lI>Whenever you make changes to the CONTENT of your website, re-save the HTML file, and whenver you make changes to the STYLE of your website, re-save the CSS file. Then refresh your webpage to reflect those changes.</lI>
                		<Li>When you are ready to publish your website and attach it to the assignment to be graded, ask Chat GPT how to publish using a free web hosting service. The one that I originally used, 000webhost, y'all said wasn't working at school, so I changed to GitHub to create this website.</Li>
